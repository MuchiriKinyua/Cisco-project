# Problem Statement
Zamani Business Park, is a development organized in blocks of five floors each. One of the blocks within the development has no network implemented that will make it possible for users
in different businesses within the block to access relevant services such as document sharing, emails and printing. To help solve the problem, the network design of the of the block within the
development will allow for a robust network that works efficiently, quickly and provides better performance overall including personal computers and work stations sharing files and can be
accessed by each other over a single internet connection. Of importance is to secure the network from security risks that interfere with the integrity of the network.

# Main Objective
To simulate a network that is reliable, scalable and runs at a high level overall which translates to improved service performance.

# Specific Objectives.
1) To design the network of Zamani Business Park.
2) To configure dynamic host configuration protocol.
3) To simulate a secure network design for the development.
4) To test the working of the designed network model.

# In Scope
The scope of Zamani business park network design is of importance in the quest of designing and implementing a good network design system for the block that is scalable, secure, flexible, quick, fault tolerant, reliable and has great performance overall for the businesses within. The network design will involve configuration of routers, switches, computers, and servers, ACLs in firewalls, protocols such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, Network Address Translation, Secure Shell and Virtual Local Area Networks using Packet Tracer.
The proposed network design will be scalable in that when the network grows there won’t be need for re-design rather use the original design to add hardware or users or build new functionality into the original design also preventing any instance of downtime on the network.
It will have high network coverage which will be implemented through various wireless access points enabling users to access various resources within the block. The proposed project will have good security which will help prevent security risks that may compromise on the integrity of the network. This will be implemented through vlans thus devices will be separated into multiple vlans thus preventing an infected computer from compromising the whole network.
This network design will be accessed by banks, corporate offices, shops, boutiques and cafes. All this will be simulated using Packet Tracer to design the network and configure network devices.

# Out of Scope
The design will cover configuration of all devices within the block save for the banks which will have the access points configured for internet access. The devices within the banks will be configured by specific banks during implementation.

# Justification
The aim of this project is to design a scalable, fault tolerant, secure and reliable network with great performance overall, as good networks have great performance which is informed by a good plan that enables high performance overall. This will enable seamless access of resources within the block for the users as security risks will be to a minimum through configuration of virtual local area networks as well as increase performance. Configuration of Dynamic Host 3Configuration Protocol will enable automatic IP address allocation within the network limiting errors through manual IP address configuration and reduced network administration. The project has a designed plan taking consideration of the network needs hence better performance. The network will work quickly and efficiently providing a good platform for users and various applications that they will use. The network will be stronger providing for scalability without compromising on its performance.

# Methodology 
For this project we’ll use PPDIOO design methodology which is a lifecycle derived from the CISCO Prepare, Plan, Design, Implement, Operate and Optimize . This methodology helps plan for changes and upgrade and even how to react to the same. To structure the project of designing and maintaining a network, CISCO divided PPDIOO into phases (teamques10, 2019) as aforementioned.

# Conclusions
In conclusion the Zamani Business Park network design has provided for a fault tolerant network design model, which is resilient and available. This translates into increased productivity and better user experiences for the customers and employees.
Furthermore, the LAN design project has embraced scalability and flexibility, allowing for seamless expansion and adaptation of the business park as it grows. The project has factored scalable architecture that can accommodate future technological advancements, increased network traffic, and the integration of new devices and applications.
Overall security is a top priority in any network design. This design incorporates good security measures to protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access. These measures include configuration of VLANS and strong access controls hence safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of critical information. In addition to that, the use of different SSIDs throughout the network facilitates good security as users have to keep seeking authentication as they connect to different access points. Lastly, with incorporation of many access points more users will be supported by the network as the capacity goes up with the number of access points on the network.

# Recommendations
Networking as a whole is a huge scope, with a lot, interesting and vast sections to cover, learn and explore. I implore the University to encourage its students especially the networking students to appreciate networking as a branch of IT and take on more networking projects so as to be equipped with the necessary skill for the market.
